To implement the search functionality for the ads, i  follow the steps below:

Create a backend API that exposes an endpoint for searching ads based on keywords entered by the user. we can use a web framework like Node.js and Express to create the API.

Define the database schema for the ads collection in MongoDB. The schema should include fields for company name, primary text, headline, description, and any other relevant fields.

Populate the ads collection with sample data.

Implement the search functionality in the backend API. You can use the MongoDB aggregation pipeline to perform a text search across the fields of the ads collection.

Expose the search endpoint over HTTP, so that the frontend can make requests to it.

In the frontend, create a search page that includes a search bar. On input, the frontend should send a request to the backend search endpoint, passing in the user's query as a parameter.

Display the results of the search in a table or other suitable format on the search page.

Optionally, you can implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large numbers of search results.

Overall, the approach would involve creating a robust and efficient backend API that leverages MongoDB's text search capabilities to return relevant ads to the user based on their search query. The frontend would simply be responsible for presenting the search results in a user-friendly format.
